# Random-Words

This program is based on the [TempleOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TempleOS) word generator developed by [Terry A. Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis). I created a Python script that randomly generates words and displays them in a graphical window.

Each time the user presses the space bar or "Enter", a new random word is added to the display. The program uses an English word list and a random number generator via the Random.org API to ensure truly random results.

## Features:
- Displays the current date.
- Generates random words with each press of the space bar or "Enter".
- Simple interface using `tkinter`.

## Installation
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
4. Run the `randomword.py` script via a terminal.
